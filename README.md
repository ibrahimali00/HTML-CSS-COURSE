# 🖥️ My Experience with "Design and Develop a Killer Website with HTML5 and CSS3" (Udemy)

Hey! 👋 I just completed [this course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/), and I wanted to share what it’s about, what I learned, and why I’d recommend it to anyone getting started with web development or design.

## 🚀 What the Course Covers

This course is **all about building a modern, responsive website** from scratch using only HTML5 and CSS3 — no frameworks, no JavaScript (aside from a tiny bit). It's super beginner-friendly, but still dives deep enough to give you solid foundations in:

- HTML5 structure & semantics
- CSS fundamentals + advanced topics (flexbox, grid, transitions, animations)
- Responsive design & media queries
- Real-world layout patterns
- Using design assets like fonts, icons, and images
- Basic wireframing & project planning
- Developer tools and debugging techniques

We build a full food delivery website called **Omnifood**, which looks amazing by the end. 💪

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to go from a wireframe to a fully responsive, polished site
- The "why" behind certain layout decisions (not just copy-pasting code)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid finally make sense to me!
- How to make a site look great on all screen sizes
- I also got more confident using DevTools to inspect and debug

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Google Chrome DevTools
- Figma (just for following along with wireframes)
- Git (optional, but I used it for version control)

## 🔥 Highlights

- Instructor explained _everything_ clearly — perfect pacing
- Lots of practice challenges and real feedback
- The final project feels portfolio-worthy
- No fluff — it’s hands-on from the beginning

## 🤔 Who I’d Recommend This To

- Absolute beginners who want to understand how websites work
- Designers who want to learn how to code their mockups
- Self-taught devs who feel shaky on the **fundamentals of HTML/CSS**
- Anyone who prefers project-based learning

## 🌐 Final Project

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This course seriously exceeded my expectations. I went from just knowing some basic tags to confidently building a full, responsive website. If you're on the fence about learning HTML & CSS or building your first real project — **this course is a solid pick**.
